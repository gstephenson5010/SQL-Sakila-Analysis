# SQL-Sakila-Analysis
Analyzing the sample database Sakila in MySQL

During my time in graduate school, I spent a lot of time learning & exploring SQL. However, since I don't use SQL on the daily basis, it has been a while since I've used some of the skills I've learned in school. For this reason, I decided to download MySQL Server & Workbench, along with a few sample databases, to practice SQL.

For this analysis, I decided to focus on the MySQL sample database titled Sakila. "Where Dell's sample database was designed to represent an online DVD store, the Sakila sample database is designed to represent a DVD rental store. The Sakila sample database still borrows film and actor names from the Dell sample database" (mysql.com).
